Hi there! My name is Ivan DJikovski and I am a software developer with over 5 years of experience working with Xamarin and the .NET stack.

I have a passion for problem-solving and enjoy using my skills and knowledge to develop efficient and effective solutions for my clients. In my current role, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, ranging from small business applications to large enterprise systems. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and industry trends.

Thank you for taking the time to read about me, and if you have any Xamarin related issues feel free to contact me.
